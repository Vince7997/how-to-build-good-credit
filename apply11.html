    </header>
    <main>
        <p>To build good credit you need a long history of successful management of credit accounts and making on time payments. 
            In order to do so, taking out a loan or having a credit card would be the first steps to building credit. 
            The more accounts that you have the better, as long as payments are being made on time. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take out a loan (credit card, installment loan)</li>
            <li>Make on time payments</li>
            <li>Increase the number of accounts you have</li>
        </ul>
